OpenGL based experimental game

My little and first experiment with OpenGL

Its a very classic vertical scroller game, created entirely from the OpenGL.

People generally don't use OpenGL directly, becasue its too low level, generally some high level game engine such as Unreal Engine is used(which uses OpenGL and other such techs at lower level but in a abstracted way).
This project gave me a deeper understanding of how games work.
